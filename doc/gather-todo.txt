INTRODUCTION *gather-todo.txt* *GatherTodo*

This plugin is a tool for dealing with multiple todo.txt files in a directory
tree. The |GatherTodo-command| recursively searches for todo.txt files and
merges the result into a new scratch buffer.  Furthermore it adds an
additional context tag to each line, to indicate the path, where this
particular todo item was found.  You can also use native vim commands for
filtering, since the result is a temporary scratch buffer.
See |GatherTodo-filtering|


USAGE *GatherTodo-command*
>
  GatherTodo [dir_names]
<
Will recursively search for todo.txt files in the tree(s) with [dir_names]
root(s). If no argument is given, the window's cwd will be used.  In the
resulting scratch buffer, a context with the path of the original todo.txt
file is added to each line.  Thus, you can jump to it with |gf|.


FILTERING *GatherTodo-filtering*

Since the result of |GatherTodo-command| is written in a new scratch buffer,
you can happily filter them with standard vim tools:

Show only todo items with `@interesting` context:
>
  v/@interesting/d
<
Don't show todo items from `+boring` project:
>
  g/+boring/d
<
